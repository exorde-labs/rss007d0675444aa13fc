"""
To perform our scraping, we use the Scrapy python library. This library fully supports asynchronous requests and is
key in being able to perform the tasks that we wish to carry out with this script.

Unfortunately, this library relies on the Twisted library which creates a Singleton instance declared globally. This means
you cannot run spiders "on the go". Once a scraping job is assigned, it must return as completed, before another one can
be assigned to the same machine.

In other words, asking machine X to perform Y scraping job and then asking X to perform Z scraping job 20s later before
Y is completed, will cause an error.

Hence, in a distributed system it is paramount to correctly assign the scraping jobs right from the start and be ready to
wait for the return statement of the worker before assigning a new task.

This following program utilizes a curated list of RSS Feeds organized under the form of a JSON file. All the links
present within this feed should have already been checked against existing entries with the RssAgglomerator.py script
and further checked on content availability and format by the RssChecker.py.

At this stage, this script will be used only to start a scraping job on a list of RSS Feeds that were selected for a
node of the distributed network. Note that certain RSS Feeds can have hundreds of entries, and in that sense, it is
paramount to correctly assess the expanse of the task before assigning it as scrapy spiders can only scrape so much
content, and certain tasks may end up taking a lot more time and resources than others.

Note that one spider will be launched for every URL submitted to avoid putting too much charge on a single spider.
